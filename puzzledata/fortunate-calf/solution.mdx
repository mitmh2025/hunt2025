This puzzle contains 7 rounds of Texas Hold 'Em Poker played against
an opponent. On the table in each round, the community cards are
arranged in increasing value (by rank, then by suit ordered Clubs,
Diamonds, Hearts, Spades), with the chips in front of each player
increasing once each round, indicating the rounds do not need to be
re-ordered. The aim of the puzzle, hinted by the flavor, is to beat the
opponent at each poker round by cheating, playing your own pairs but not
getting caught.

Looking closely at the opponent each round, you can see his hole cards
reflected in his glasses. This tells you what his best hand is, which
you must beat by swapping the cards you have hidden in your sleeves.
However, there is nowhere close to a unique way to beat the dealer in
each hand, suggesting that the hidden cards are set and must be
determined from the round answer feeders.

It turns out that each of the 7 feeders to the puzzle have a
commonality: aside from all being 13 letters long, each feeder contains
the name of a card rank as a substring (e.g. Ace, Nine, King), hinted by
"keep rank" and "conceal your con" in the flavor text. In addition, each
feeder begins with either the letter C, H, or S, which are abbreviations
for card suits. From this, we can infer that each feeder is associated
with a specific playing card from the standard 52-card deck:

| Feeder Answer | Card |
| ------------- | ---- |
| <span style={blue}>C</span>A<span style={red}>NINE</span>PARTNER | 9♣ |
| <span style={blue}>C</span>HEE<span style={red}>SEVEN</span>DORS | 7♣ |
| <span style={blue}>C</span>HO<span style={red}>KING</span>HAZARD | K♣ |
| <span style={blue}>H</span>ARDDISKSP<span style={red}>ACE</span> | A♥ |
| <span style={blue}>S</span>L<span style={red}>EIGHT</span>OFHAND | 8♠ |
| <span style={blue}>S</span>P<span style={red}>ACE</span>WARSHIPS | A♠ |
| <span style={blue}>S</span><span style={red}>TEN</span>OGRAPHERS | 10♠ |

These cards represent the pool of cards you have hidden up your sleeves.
Given this set, there is a unique way to beat the opponent in each round
of poker, with one distinction: you cannot play cards that are already
on the table, otherwise you will be caught cheating. In this way, each
card will be used exactly twice ("double up"), which provides
confirmation of the correct assignment.

The 13-letter feeders, alongside the numbers for the card ranks,
strongly indicate indexing into the feeders. Given the 7 pairings of
cards, you must use each card's rank (Ace = 1, King = 13) to index
into the other card, extracting 7 bigrams. The bigram ordering can
easily be brute-forced, but the dealer's button indicates which to
use. For the rounds where you bet a big blind (you are the dealer), the
letter extracted from the card of greater value goes first, and
conversely, for rounds where you bet a small blind, the letter extracted
from the card of lesser value goes first. Combining all 7 bigrams
produces the answer `FACECARDSHARKS`.
