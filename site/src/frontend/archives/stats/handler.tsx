            The 2025 MIT Mystery Hunt kicked off at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard
            Time on Friday, January 17th. The first puzzles became unlockable at
            1:00 PM. <strong>Cardinality</strong> solved the final metapuzzle at
            8:56 AM on Sunday, January 19th and, while failing to recover the
            Shadow Diamond, did receive a stash of coins at 12:17 PM. The Gala
            and HQ remained open until 10:00 PM on Sunday, although teams
            enthusiastically continued to solve even after HQ had closed. Stats
            are based on progress until 12:45 PM on Monday, January 20th when
            solutions were released.

              Roughly <strong>5,000</strong> people participated in the Hunt
              (according to teams‚Äô self-reported sizes), of which roughly{" "}
              <strong>2,300</strong> joined us on-campus at MIT. Those 5,000
              people were split across <strong>219</strong> teams that
              registered for Hunt, of which <strong>103</strong> had any
              on-campus presence.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>195</strong> teams solved at least 1 puzzle.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>96</strong> teams solved at least 1 metapuzzle.

            <li>
              <strong>64</strong> teams solved{" "}
              <a href={`${rootUrl}/puzzles/the_thief`}>The Thief</a> and learned
              who stole the Shadow Diamond.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>34</strong> teams solved at least one late round
              supermetapuzzle (either a character‚Äôs side investigation or The
              Murder in MITropolis)
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>11</strong> teams finished the Hunt.
