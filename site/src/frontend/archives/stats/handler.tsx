            The 2025 MIT Mystery Hunt kicked off at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard
            Time on Friday, January 17th. The first puzzles became unlockable at
            1:00 PM. <strong>Cardinality</strong> solved the final metapuzzle at
            8:56 AM on Sunday, January 19th and, while failing to recover the
            Shadow Diamond, did receive a stash of coins at 12:17 PM. The Gala
            and HQ remained open until 10:00 PM on Sunday, although teams
            enthusiastically continued to solve even after HQ had closed. Stats
            are based on progress until 12:45 PM on Monday, January 20th when
            solutions were released.

            <li>
              Those 5,000 people were split across <strong>219</strong> teams
              that registered for Hunt, of which <strong>103</strong> had any
              on-campus presence.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>{solvedOne}</strong> teams solved at least 1 puzzle.

              who stole the Shadow Diamond.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>{solvedLateSuper}</strong> teams solved at least one late

            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>{solvedHunt}</strong> teams finished the Hunt.
