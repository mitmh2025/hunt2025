      Weâ€™ve learned that an informant is interested in giving up some
      information. Please send 1â€“2 trainees who like to make connections and
      make new friends, and who can move around a room for the duration of the
      event. Please arrive promptly; participation cannot be guaranteed for late
      arrivals.

  tailing_a_lead: (
    <>
      Please send 1â€“2 trainees who can think on their feet, are masters of
      disguise, and have a sixth sense for sneakiness. Each person should bring
      a towelâ€“a most massively useful thing. Paper, a writing utensil, and a
      clipboard could also come in handy. Theyâ€™ll be tailing a lead for a while,
      so they should be comfortable with moderate physical activity, including
      navigating stairs.

  navigating_high_society: (
    <>
      Please send 1â€“2 trainees with an eye for detail. Theyâ€™ll be handing
      lemons, limes, oranges, cherries, and grapes; although nothing will be
      consumed, do not send anyone with food allergies to this event. Please
      note that this event is not colorblind-friendly.

  seeing_the_big_picture: (
    <>
      Please send 1â€“2 trainees with a flair for creativity, who can assess a
      crime scene and see things in new ways.
