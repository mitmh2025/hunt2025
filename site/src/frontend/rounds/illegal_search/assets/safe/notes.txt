The `_zarvox` file variants are the result of Drew modifying the draft files
from the Google Drive, removing objects from the svg that are marked as
invisible.  This reduces the combined file size to the size of one of the
assets.

These assets need additional revision -- the center of the dial is not placed
at the center of the viewBox, which means that rotating the image causes it to
process slightly, which means the dial no longer aligns with the
highlight/shadow layer (which needs to not rotate, to stay aligned with the
room lighting).
