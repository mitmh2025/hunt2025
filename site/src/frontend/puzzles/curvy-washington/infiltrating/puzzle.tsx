        The key to blending in among the seedy underbelly of MITropolis is
        building up street cred. In order to succeed, you will need to
        demonstrate feats of criminality to meet a minimum threshold of street
        cred. Larger PI training firms will need more street cred to build up a
        sufficient network of informants, naturally.

        Your criminal peers are discerning. For each feat of criminality, you
        may earn up to a maximum amount of street cred. You will be judged on
        credibility, gumption (effort), and moxie (skill).
