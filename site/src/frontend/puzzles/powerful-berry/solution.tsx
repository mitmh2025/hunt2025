        Solvers are presented with a very long ribbon, with a number of tags
        attached at intervals. Upon inspecting the labels, they will find that
        each label either has a flag on one side and a drawing with a number in
        degrees on the other side, or the name of a location. One more label at
        one end of the ribbon is labeled with a sun icon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If solvers measure the ribbon, they will find it is 40 meters long. The
        locations of the tags are below:

        If solvers go to 8-322, they will find that it is next to the location
        of Pluto in The Infinite Solar System, the scale model of the solar
        system installed on the third floor of the Infinite Corridor. The puzzle
        itself is also a scale model of the solar system at a scale of 1 AU = 1
        meter. Tags labeled with locations are the locations of the eight
        planets plus Pluto in various scale model solar systems across the
        world, from Sweden‚Äôs model at 1:20,000,000 to MIT‚Äôs at 1:30,000,000,000!
        Planet tags are located along the ribbon at the reported distance for
        each model (some models measure walking distance, so the straight-line
        as the crow flies distance is shorter).

        Solvers must now locate each model‚Äôs sun on a map and determine the sun
        to planet direction. Each tag with a flag can be matched to a planet
        walk. If solvers were standing at the sun in that model and looking
        directly at the model of the planet marked on the ribbon, they could
        adjust their bearing by the specified number of degrees (clockwise or
        counterclockwise, as indicated by the arrow) and travel the specified
        distance to find another local landmark. Solvers can use online
        geocaching tools, linked in the appendix below, to calculate the
        location of the landmark once they have identified the latitude and
        longitude of each sun/planet pair using google maps. The drawings on the
        backs of the tags, along with the alphabetized enumerations in the
        puzzle document, confirm that solvers have found the correct landmark,
        and the language on each planet tag indicates what language to write the
        landmark name in.

        Diagonalizing, or indexing into each landmark‚Äôs name by the number of
        its planet, reveals the answer, <PuzzleAnswer>SKY REPLAY</PuzzleAnswer>.

        In order to calculate the coordinates of the landmark, one must first

        can find the ‚Äúabsolute‚Äù degree measurement from due north in which they
        must look to find the clued landmark. The distance to said landmark is
        given by the location of its tag along the ribbon. With these data
