      <p>
        Solvers are given a gibberish block of monospaced text, and also some
        circular shapes. If solvers search in the block of text, they find that
        the circular shapes will line up with text that spells out a clue of a
        historical event. To aid in identification, the starting 4 letters are
        provided, the first letter in red and the following 3 in orange. When
        investigating these clues, solvers realize that each clue identifies
        both a year, and a monarch (all top-of-the-hierarchy monarchs, i.e.
        kings and emperors). As a check of solvers‚Äô work, the circles are
        ordered in alpha-order by the name of the monarch. Solvers should order
        these monarchs in chronological order of the event. Earlier when finding
        the clues, solvers will have noticed that each clue has an extra ‚ÄúX‚Äù in
        it. If solvers take the position of this ‚ÄúX‚Äù in the clue as an index
        into the monarch names, they‚Äôll spell{" "}
        <Mono>COUNTRY OF GREATEST ECLIPSE</Mono>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point solvers will realize that they should look to NASA‚Äôs
        catalog of eclipses throughout history. If they look at the year of each
        of the events they found in the previous step, they will see that there
        was exactly one total eclipse during the year of each monarch‚Äôs event.
        (Get it, get it, the ‚Äúcorona‚Äù of the eclipse clues a monarch, since
        ‚Äúcorona‚Äù means ‚Äúcrown‚Äù üòè.) As confirmation that solvers are interested
        in the total eclipses, and not, say, the annular ones, the flavor text
        references the total solar eclipse in 2024, for which the point of
        greatest eclipse was in Mexico. They‚Äôll also notice that the point of
        greatest eclipse (indicated by the star shape on NASA‚Äôs maps) lands on a
        country. Solvers should now reuse the index from earlier, the one from
        the position of the ‚ÄúX‚Äù in the clue, to index into the countries that
        they found, again taking them in chronological order. Reading off these
        indexed letters gives a new cluephrase,{" "}
        <Mono>CAESAR BELTS, KING ECLIPSES SON</Mono>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cluephrase indicates to solvers that they should look to the
        equators of the moons (the part eclipsing the sun / ‚Äúson‚Äù). As extra
        indication that this is the correct move, solvers may have noticed that
        all of the circles had an odd-length height, thus having a well-defined
        equator within the grid. The moon diagram at the bottom of the puzzle
        serves as a glossary, to help solvers confirm that ‚Äúbelt‚Äù here is cluing
        the equator. Here, if they try to caesar shift the letters on the
        equator, they‚Äôll find that it hides the name of the father of the
        monarch that was clued in the corona (who was also a king prior to his
        son). The equators are padded with words that are clearly filler
        (‚Äútrash‚Äù, ‚Äújunk‚Äù, ‚Äúresidue‚Äù) to aid in identifying the correct shift.
        However, one letter will be wrong in the father‚Äôs name. If solvers note
        the shift value of the caesar shifts, they‚Äôll notice that the shifts are
        all unique, 1-26. Using the shift as an ordering and taking the letter
        that was incorrect, solvers arrive at the phrase{" "}
        <Mono>MAKE PARODY OF BONNIE TYLER HIT</Mono>, indicating to teams that
        they should put together a parody of ‚ÄúTotal Eclipse of the Heart‚Äù (or
        decide to be contrarian and make a parody of a different hit).
      </p>
      <p>
        When solvers submitted their parody, they were provided with the final
        answer, <PuzzleAnswer>[pending]</PuzzleAnswer>.
