          Send 2-4 investigators with no mobility or hearing impairments to the
          Gala, and ask around for Billie. They will need your teamâ€™s radio.
          They will need to be able to do quite a bit of walking, but very
          little of it outside. They may be out of your office for an hour or so
          with the radio, so remember to tune to 2pi in your browser.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you cannot do this on-campus activity due to campus availability or
          accessibility concerns, or you are stuck or not having fun, you may
          contact HQ if this puzzle has been open for at least 3 hours and we
          will arrange an alternative for you. However, we strongly recommend
          you experience it in person if possible.
