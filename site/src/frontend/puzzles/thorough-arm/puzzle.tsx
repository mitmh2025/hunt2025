        An intrepid group of eight adventurers decided to celebrate their latest
        victory by hitting up the local tavern. Predictably, each adventurer had
        too much of their drink of choice and passed out. How did they appease
        the bar staff the next day?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fighter:</strong> Ugh, what a brutal night. At least I got to
        see all of it, and have 15 drinks to boot!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sorcerer:</strong> That’s probably because you weren’t drinking
        liquor. Not that that stopped you from cleaving your tankards in twain.
        Liquor is where I went wrong though, I should have stuck to the lighter
        stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bard:</strong> I didn’t have much, but Alison had even less than
        me. I just barely stayed awake to see her keel over before I passed out
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Artificer:</strong> I remember Tabitha and Yaron were having a
        drinking contest. They went drink-for-drink for a while, but Tabitha won
        by exactly one drink. She passed out right after him, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paladin:</strong> You made the right choice drinking wine, I
        imagine it’s best to drink something light while crafting. Now that I
        think about it, you spend all your free time making rings. How many
        rings do you even need?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fighter:</strong> Indeed, our friend the Artificer had as many
        drinks as Gracie and Yaron combined!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wizard:</strong> Alas, I fell one drink short of Gracie’s total.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fighter:</strong> Tabitha did have fewer than ten drinks, but I
        know she didn’t have exactly eight—that was someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Monk:</strong> Well, that’s not many drinks, now is it? Tabitha
        should know better than to drink things made from grapes, she’s
        allergic. August had a grape-based drink too and he’s fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rogue:</strong> You only think that’s not many because you
        weren’t drinking spirits. You know, one would think a Monk so fluid as
        yourself would be willing to switch it up a bit from their usual.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sorcerer:</strong> And yet our dear Monk managed to put back far
        more drinks than you, even though you outlasted her!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rogue:</strong> Wow, there’s thirteen empty bottles of ale at
        our table.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wizard:</strong> Way to deflect, you’re always so shifty. I
        suppose I should expect that from a Rogue, though. Anyways, I know you
        had a prime number of drinks, but it wasn’t thirteen.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sorcerer:</strong> What on earth is a “prime number”, Patrick?
        You really learn that stuff at Wizard school? Nerd. No wonder your
        familiar flapped away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paladin:</strong> Well then! You had the least to drink, comrade
        Sorcerer, everyone else had already surpassed your total of five drinks
        when you passed out. You’re usually so self-reflective—perhaps it’s time
        to do some thinking about whether you can keep up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Artificer:</strong> I heartily agree with that, my Paladin
        friend, and I admire your dedication to rooting out evil. As I recall,
        Bill was drinking mead, and he was still standing after I. We should all
        follow his example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bard:</strong> I agree with you as well, Artificer. You, Bill,
        and Tabitha were still drinking when I fell asleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paladin:</strong> Wow, whoever was drinking rye and gin didn’t
        have much at all. Those two have the fewest empty glasses. Meanwhile,
        tequila has the most empties of all the spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Monk:</strong> Rye and gin had the fewest orders? That’s odd,
        because vodka and fernet aren’t very palatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Artificer:</strong> That’s obviously not a universal truth,
        because this set of nine empty glasses is for one of those spirits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bard:</strong> I’m scraping the bottom of the figurative barrel
        here, but I remember seeing twelve identical branded glasses in front of
        someone who passed out before me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Wizard:</strong> What a useful detail. Boy, your memory is
        terrible. Is that why you always keep notes? Here’s one for you all:
        Oliver had exactly seven drinks before I saw him go under the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rogue:</strong> Ugh. You’re all the worst. I’m never drinking
        gin ever again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Everyone:</strong> Oh no! The bartender!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bartender:</strong> One of you jerks had TWENTY ONE drinks and
        we had to clean up after ALL of you. And now you’re just standing around
        insulting each other? You all need an attitude adjustment.
      </p>
