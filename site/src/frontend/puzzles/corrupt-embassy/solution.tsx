      <p>
        This puzzle combines Eurovision entries and common fairytale motifs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each (very) short story contains both the description for the staging of
        a memorable Eurovision entry, plus additional strange details.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in ‚ÄúOnce upon a time there were six old women baking bread
        who were brought back from the dead by music‚Äù, the six old women baking
        bread is a description of the staging of ‚ÄòParty for Everybody‚Äô by
        Buranovskiye Babushki (which was Russia‚Äôs entry in 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifying all of the Eurovision entries and taking the first letter of
        each song‚Äôs title in order spells out <Mono>STITH THOMPSON MOTIF</Mono>.
        This is a categorisation system for common motifs in fairytales.
      </p>
      <p>
        The additional details in each story correspond to a common motif. For
        example, ‚Äúbrought back from the dead by music‚Äù is E55 in the
        Stith-Thompson motif index (‚Äòresuscitation by music‚Äô).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each country‚Äôs flag also has an associated score. For example, Russia‚Äôs
        score is 61. The difference between the score and the number in the
        motif index gives a letter to extract (in this case 61 - 55 = 6 ‚Üí F).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ordering the extracted letters by the starting letter in the motif index
        (E in this case) gives the clue phrase TARIFA SONG ALBANIAN. Eneda
        Tarifa represented Albania with the song ‚ÄòFairytale‚Äô in Eurovision in
        2016, but its original title in Albanian was{" "}
        <PuzzleAnswer>PERRALLE</PuzzleAnswer>, which is the answer to the
        puzzle.
