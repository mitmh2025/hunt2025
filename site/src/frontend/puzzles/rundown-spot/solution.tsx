        As hinted by the title, the dropquote represents a roulette wheel â€“
        specifically, a European roulette wheel with only one green 0 slot
        (compared to the American variant with 0 and 00):
      </p>
      <LinkedImage alt="A European roulette wheel" src={img1} />
      <p>
        The flavortext and the colors/images in the center 0 slot all hint at
        the six outside bets in a game of roulette, which pay out at 1:1. Those
        six bets are odd, even, low, high, red, and black.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each bet, you can go around the roulette wheel clockwise and drop
        one letter from each slot to spell out words or phrases. Those phrases{" "}
        <b>should</b> contain the name of the bet, but the name is elided:

        There is one letter left over in each of the thirty-seven slots. Read
        them in numerical order from 0 to 36 to get the answer: HAL INSTITUTE
        FOR CRIMINALLY INSANE ROBOTS.
