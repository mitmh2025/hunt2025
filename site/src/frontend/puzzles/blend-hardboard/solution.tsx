        These are plot summaries for well-known operas, alphabetically by
        composer.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the names are wrong. Reordering so that each description
        follows the one where its (Anglicised) name should be creates a chain,
        and the initial letters of the opera titles spell out{" "}
        <PuzzleAnswer>LA GIOCONDA</PuzzleAnswer>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 60-minute run times and the chain of names also subtly suggest{" "}
        <Mono>THE DANCE OF THE HOURS</Mono>, which is a famous ballet sequence
        in the opera <i>La Gioconda</i>.

        she’s regretting her decision to put the family first. (60 min)

        Set in the Scottish lowlands. This is the famous operatic “mad scene”.

        <strong>Albert Herring</strong> (Britten)
      </h3>

        3pm <strong>The Butcher, the Baker and Whatshisname</strong>
      </div>
      <div>
        The only virgin left in town has been crowned at the spring festival.
        But Sid and <s>Henry</s> NANCY are up to old tricks. After a spiked
        lemonade and some life lessons, will the May Monarch still be dressed in
        white? (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        Guessing NANCY and then searching “Sid Nancy opera” may be the easiest
        way to find this. Albert’s white clothes are central to the plot in Act
        3. Hoping that there will be some humour if solvers fall into the same
        error the town committee makes, i.e. assuming that the virginal May
        Monarch must be female.
      </div>
      <div>
        Title: Sid is a Butcher; Nancy is a Baker. There is a running joke in
        the opera that nobody can remember the title character’s name.

        <strong>Gotterdammerung</strong> (Wagner) (German Brunnhilde)

        already looking for new adventures. Is he going to sell her down the
        river, or will he be back before time runs out? (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        “To new adventures” are the opening words of Act 1. Siegfried’s journey
        down the Rhine is the most famous musical passage (together with the
        concluding liebestod). At the end of Act 3, it turns out to be an opera
        about the end of time. (There’s also some treachery and spouse-swapping
        in between, but that’s less interesting!)
      </div>

        Title: Wagner’s theory of opera was a “total work of art”

        <s>Hilda</s> ROBERT finally visits their betrothed, but only after
        falling in love with someone else. His friend takes a stroll in her
        garden and finds that a rose of another colour might smell as sweet.
        Will she do what it takes to be able to see him? (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        Searching “blind woman opera” is likely to find this. The entire opera
        is about Iolanta’s blindness. The friend (Count Vaudemont) falls in love
        with Iolanta and asks her for a red rose. When she instead picks a white
        one, he realises she is blind.

        Will he succeed? And then will he succeed? She’s lost a handkerchief,
        but how much more will she lose? (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        You may know the plot of Othello, even if you didn’t know that it’s also
        a famous opera! The maidservant is named Emilia in Shakespeare, exactly
        as in Verdi.

        <strong>Carmen</strong> (Bizet) (Spanish Jose)

      </div>
      <div>
        After falling for a local trouble-maker from the cigarette factory,{" "}
        <s>Emily</s> JOE spent two months in the brig for refusing an order. Now
        they’ve gone on the run together. Will he break free of her spell, or be
        left with a faded flower? (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        Carmen throws a flower to Jose, and he treasures it during the whole of
        the two months in prison; there’s a famous aria about it (“La fleur que
        tu m’avais jetée”). The one thing everybody knows about this opera is
        that there are bullfighters (Refrain, “Toréador, en garde”).

        <strong>Orlando</strong> (Handel) (Italian Angelica)

      <div>
        Love is in the air, and tranquility is gone. <s>Joe</s> ANGIE’s in love
        with a wounded soldier. Enter a rival, who has taken French leave. After
        trying to kill her, and torching her cottage, the visitor pleads
        temporary insanity and returns to the wars, where he can resume killing
        in a more socially acceptable fashion. (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        “Insanity” should be helpful: this is also on the list of Top 10 mad
        scenes. Not that easy to recognise otherwise; nobody cares specifically
        what Orlando did when he was Furioso. But should be relatively easy to
        confirm when looking at the synopsis of the right opera.
      </div>
      <div>
        Title: Orlando is consistently described as being a “great warrior”.

        home and ready to learn. In the Summer Palace she has a vision of the
        world at peace. After yet another big dinner, her husband admits that he
        was wrong. (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        Arguably the most famous opera of the last 50 years. The summary is a
        direct description of Pat’s role in Act 2. It may sound like her husband
        is apologising for a domestic dispute, but it’s actually President Nixon
        apologising for the United States policy on China.

        father, and corners him at a wedding reception. She tries to round up a
        posse to seek revenge, but her father proves surprisingly capable of
        standing up for himself. Guess who’s coming to dinner. (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        It’s an extremely famous opera, so fewer hints, but it should be easy to
        recognise when you think of the right opera. It’s “surprising” that the
        father stands up for himself, because he is dead. He has returned in the
        form of a stone statue.

      <div>
        A young composer just wants a bit of respect. What he gets is a load of
        song and dance. His teacher tries to convince him that the show must go
        on, but <s>Anna</s> NETTIE’s attentions prove more persuasive. Will he
        get more than he bargained for? Fireworks are guaranteed, and the dance
        ends here. (60 min)
      </div>
      <div>
        From the Wikipedia summary: “At first, the impetuous young Composer
        refuses to discuss any changes to his opera. But his teacher, the Music
        Master, points out… A dancing master introduces Zerbinetta… The Composer
        realizes what he has assented to, plunges into despair and storms out.
