                The MIT Mystery Hunt is a puzzlehunt competition that takes
                place on the MIT campus every year during Martin Luther King,
                Jr. Day weekend, a student tradition dating back more than 40
                years. Teams of intrepid adventurers solve puzzles all weekend
                long in a race to find a coin hidden on campus. To learn more
                about the tradition and see previous events, check out

                construction; the exact location(s) of kickoff will be published
                at a later date. Puzzles will be released at 1:00 PM.

                Hunt Headquarters will remain open through 10:00 PM on Sunday,
                January 19th. There will be a

                Teams who have been assigned space on campus for their HQs must
                vacate during that time, but teams operating out of their living
                group are of course welcome to continue. During campus closure
                times you can continue solving puzzles, but non-students cannot
                be on campus.

                We will continue to operate the Hunt website for solving,

              <p>
                The MIT Mystery Hunt is at its core an on-campus event, and we
                believe that it is best experienced in person. While we expect
                there to be many puzzles that are accessible to remote solvers,
                there will also be many physical puzzles, on-campus puzzles,
                interactions, and activities that can only be done in person.
              </p>
              <p>
                There will be many puzzles and interactions that fully remote
                teams cannot complete, and because figuring out that a puzzle
                requires MIT knowledge or campus presence is part of the puzzle,
                they will not usually be labeled as such.

              </p>
              <p>
                However, we are still excited to share the MIT Mystery Hunt with
                the rest of the global puzzling community. After the live event
                ends, post-solvable versions of all puzzles will become
                available &ndash; with photographs, maps, data tables, and
                whatever else a fully remote team would need to complete the
                Hunt.

            <h3>
              Can my team use on-campus space as a headquarters during Hunt?
            </h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                If you would like to use classroom space for your HQ during
                Hunt, there will be a place to indicate this in your general
                registration which will open in early December. You can expect
                confirmation about your assigned space from us in early January.
                Please do not contact the Schedules Office directly for space
                during the MIT Mystery Hunt, as we've already worked with them to
                reserve rooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                As always, reservable space on campus can get tight and more and
                more spaces have become department-only. If your team is able to
                hunt out of non-reservable spaces like living group lounges or
                restricted department spaces, that's even better!

                >
                The MIT Puzzle Club is running this as a live event for current
                students in October. Students who are interested should join the
                Puzzle Club Discord server (which you can find via the <a
                href="https://discord.com/student-hubs">MIT Discord
                Hub</a>)</a>for more information. These puzzles are expected to
                be on the easier side and are a great opportunity to recruit
                your friends, hallmates, and labmates into the Hunt community.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the rest of the MIT Mystery Hunt community, Team Providence
                will make the pre-Hunt round available online in the fall at
                some point following the Puzzle Club event.
              </p>
              <p>
                The pre-Hunt round will tie directly into the story of this
                year's MIT Mystery Hunt. However, none of the puzzle content or
                answers will be used in Hunt, and solving the pre-Hunt will not
                be necessary or helpful toward solving the MIT Mystery Hunt
                itself.

          <div class="question">
            <h3>What's the recommended team size?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                There is no official team size recommendation, and this question
                is very difficult to answer as it depends entirely on your taste
                and style.
              </p>
              <p>
                For newer and smaller teams, you should know that the MIT
                Mystery Hunt is larger than other puzzle hunts that occur
                throughout the year. While we will do everything in our power to
                make sure teams of all sizes and experience levels have a fun
                and satisfying experience, very small teams are unlikely to see
                all of the Hunt. Teams which complete the Hunt will likely have
                30 or more solvers working intensely throughout the weekend. If
                you're debating inviting friends and hallmates to hunt with you,
                you probably should.
              </p>
              <p>
                For larger teams, you have a sense of your style and how you
                like to solve. We expect that teams will initially have around
                10 puzzles available simultaneously, increasing to around 20
                over the course of the Hunt. We also expect that the total
                number of puzzles will be in line with MIT Mystery Hunts of the
                last decade. We don't intend to release any additional
                information about the Hunt structure in advance, so we encourage
                you to use this information to decide how you want to approach
                team structure and recruiting for this year.

          <div class="question">
            <h3>How can I support the MIT Mystery Hunt?</h3>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                If you are a current student, the best way to help the MIT Mystery
                Hunt is to <strong>join the MIT Puzzle Club</strong> and recruit
                more friends to participate both in Puzzle Club and
                Hunt. There could be no MIT Mystery Hunt without the
                participation of the MIT community; growing that community
                ensures its future.
              </p>

                For anyone else who is able to contribute, we would greatly
                appreciate your financial support. It does not cost anything to
                sign up and participate in the MIT Mystery Hunt. The organizers
                are not getting paid, but Hunt does still cost real
                money to produce and run&mdash;around $10 per person. Aside from a few valued corporate
                sponsors, Mystery Hunt and the MIT Puzzle Club are primarily
                funded by a large number of small donations. If you are in a
                position to do so, your
                <a href="https://giving.mit.edu/form?fundId=2720842"
                  >tax-deductible donations designated to the MIT Puzzle Club</a
                >
                make the MIT Mystery Hunt possible.
